## ðŸš€ Step-by-Step Publication Process

### Step 1: Set Up pub.dev Account

1. **Create Google Account** (if you don't have one):
   - Go to [accounts.google.com](https://accounts.google.com)
   - Create a new Google account or use existing one

2. **Sign in to pub.dev**:
   - Visit [pub.dev](https://pub.dev)
   - Click "Sign in" in the top right
   - Sign in with your Google account

3. **Accept Publisher Agreement**:
   - First time users need to accept the publisher agreement

### Step 2: Install and Configure Flutter SDK

Make sure you have the latest Flutter SDK:

```bash
# Check Flutter version
flutter --version

# Upgrade if needed
flutter upgrade

# Ensure pub is working
flutter pub --version
```

### Step 3: Validate Your Package

Navigate to your package directory and run validation:

```bash
cd /Users/durgeshparekh/Documents/GitHub/notification_badge

# Check package health
flutter pub deps

# Run dry-run publish (validates without publishing)
flutter pub publish --dry-run
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Package validation found the following issues:

* No issues found!

The server may enforce additional checks.
```

If there are any issues, fix them before proceeding.

### Step 4: Test Your Package Thoroughly

1. **Test Example App**:
```bash
cd example
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

2. **Test on Multiple Platforms**:
   - Test on iOS simulator/device
   - Test on Android emulator/device
   - Test different Android OEMs if possible

3. **Verify All Features Work**:
   - Badge count setting/getting
   - Background/foreground state handling
   - OEM-specific implementations
   - Error handling

### Step 5: Final Package Preparation

1. **Verify Package Structure**:
```bash
# List all files that will be published
flutter pub publish --dry-run --verbose
```

2. **Check LICENSE File**:
```bash
# Ensure LICENSE file exists and is properly formatted
cat LICENSE
```

3. **Verify Documentation Links**:
   - Ensure all links in README.md work
   - Verify example code is accurate
   - Check that all referenced files exist

### Step 6: Publish to pub.dev

1. **Authentication** (first time only):
```bash
# Authenticate with pub.dev
flutter pub login
```
This will:
   - Open a browser window
   - Ask you to sign in with Google
   - Provide an authentication token
   - Store credentials locally

2. **Final Dry Run**:
```bash
# One final validation
flutter pub publish --dry-run
```

3. **Publish the Package**:
```bash
# Publish to pub.dev
flutter pub publish
```

**You'll see prompts like:**
```
